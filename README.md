# DanganronpaTextGenerator
This is a content generator I have worked on to allow users to generate content that looks like it's from the Danganronpa Series of games (Specifically Danganronpa 2). The section that generates the files is made in Python, and the section that reads the files and generates the footage is coded in C# and run in Unity.
